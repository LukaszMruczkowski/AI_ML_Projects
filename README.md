## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) covers a range of techniques that appear as sentient behavior by the computer. For example, AI is used to recognize faces in photographs on your social media, beat the World’s Champion in chess, and process your speech when you speak to Siri or Alexa on your phone. This course will explore some of the ideas that make AI possible

* Search: Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move
* Knowledge: Representing information and drawing inferences from it
* Uncertainty: Dealing with uncertain events using probability
* Optimization: Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem but a better—or the best—way to solve it
* Learning: Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email can distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on experience
* Neural Networks: A program structure inspired by the human brain that can perform tasks effectively
* Language: Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans

## [Search](Search/)

Search problems involve an agent that is given an initial state and a goal state, and it returns a solution of how to get from the former to the latter

### Objectives

- Search Problem Terms
- Algorithms
- Adversarial Search

### Projects

- [Degrees](/Search/degrees/)
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](/Search/tictactoe/)

## Knowledge

Humans reason based on existing knowledge and conclude. The concept of representing knowledge and drawing conclusions from it is also used in AI, and this lecture will explore how we can achieve this behavior

### Objectives

- Propositional Logic
- Inference
- First Order Logic

### Projects

- [Knights](/Knowledge/knights/)
- [Minesweeper](/Knowledge/minesweeper/)

## [Uncertainty](Uncertainty/)

Last lecture shows how AI can represent knowledge and from that, derive new knowledge. But in reality, usually, we don't have that much knowledge for certain. Most of the time AI can only have partial knowledge leaving some space for uncertainty. Still, we would want the AI to make the best possible decision during these situations

### Objectives

- Probability
- Random Variables
- Sampling

### Projects

- [PageRank](Uncertainty/pagerank/)
- [Heredity](Uncertainty/heredity/)

## [Optimization](Optimization/)

Optimization is choosing the best option from a set of possible options. We have already encountered problems where we tried to find the best possible option, such as in the minimax algorithm, and this lecture will learn about tools that we can use to solve an even broader range of problems

### Objectives

- Local Search
- Linear Programming
- Constraint Satisfaction

### Projects

- [Crossword](Optimization/crossword/)

## [Learning](Learning/)

Machine learning provides a computer with data, rather than explicit instructions. Using these data, the computer learns to recognize patterns and becomes able to execute tasks on its own

### Objectives

- Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

### Projects

- [Shopping](Learning/shopping/)
- [Nim](Learning/nim/)

## [Neural Networks](Neural_Networks/)

AI neural networks are inspired by neuroscience. In the brain, neurons are cells that are connected, forming networks. Each neuron is capable of both receiving and sending electrical signals. Once the electrical input that a neuron receives crosses some threshold, the neuron activates, thus sending its electrical signal forward

### Objectives

- Structure and Algorithms
- Computer Vision
- Recurrent Neural Networks

### Projects

- [Traffic](Neural_Networks/traffic/)
